# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

In this project, we used geoJSON date to map earthquakes using Leaflet. We made several branches that contain different exercises we used to gain familiarity with the library. We used different mapbox styles to show maps in different ways and we created several overlays. In Earthquake_Challenge we plotted earthquake data from several sources, then plotted it using circle markers that vary in size by magnitude and added lines around the tectonic plate locations. All layers can be added or removed for a clearer view.
